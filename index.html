            Hi, my name is Alexander Nguyen, and I’m a master’s student in Computer Science at UCSB. 
            This is my fifth year here, as I also completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering. 
            My interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, distributed systems, and networking. 
            Outside of academics, I love trying new foods, traveling, and watching movies and shows.
        </p>
