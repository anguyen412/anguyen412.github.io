                    Hi, my name is Alexander Nguyen, and I’m a master’s student in Computer Science at UCSB. 
                    This is my fifth year here, as I also completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering. 
                    My interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, distributed systems, and networking. 
                    Outside of academics, I love trying new foods, traveling, and watching movies and shows.
                </p>
