        <h1>Why I love trying new foods</h1>
        <p>
            I love exploring new foods and cuisines because I believe food is one of the best ways to experience a culture. 
            Whenever I travel, trying local dishes is what I look forward to the most. 
            Someday, I’d love to travel across Asia and taste the diversity of regional foods. 
            Some things on my bucket list are trying street food in Korea, dining at a hawker center in Singapore, 
            or wandering through a busy night market in Thailand.

                    I enjoy making Korean food because of the simple ingredients and preparation.
